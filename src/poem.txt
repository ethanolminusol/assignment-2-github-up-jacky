Looking through the monitor as I breathe,
Within resides a woman I want to meet.
An echo of stress, a relentless chase,
Yet, your voice on the call gave a warmly embrace.

The gap between us spans miles,
Yet, my lips have journeyed through myriad smiles.
We converse as if time has woven our years,
Dispelling my lingering anxieties and fears.

We may not be familiar in reality,
So, why am I inclined to share my meal with thee?
What's this peculiar emotion stealing over me?
Am I descending for the girl beyond the monitor, can it be?

Seems that in the vast expanse of the digital domain,
Two hearts entwined, but virtual refrain.
All started with laughter, a chuckle.
But now share interests and dreams, a bond subtle.

I realized something in the morning sun,
A confession emerges, the journey begun.
Through the pixels and wires that kept us apart,
Love transcends boundaries, a work of digital art.

Here's to the love that knows no bounds,
In the digital tapestry, where affection resounds.
Across various heavens painted in shades of blue,
I still want to say I love you.
